## Warnings

### Reddit

New Reddit accounts will likely get banned with the bot. Let an account sit for a few days before using it. Do not use
an account that you love, as it's possible to be permanently banned.

### Heroku

The bot used to have a Heroku option - till they found out and now using the bot on heroku will get your account banned.
